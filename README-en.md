# A sample project for MMC access on Enhanced PIC16F series

Some of the Enhanced midrange PIC16F series, such as PIC16F18857, have very large program and data memory that allows them to read and write MMC compatible cards (SD cards) with a FAT file system.

This project is a sample project for reading and writing MMC using ChaN's FatFs.
